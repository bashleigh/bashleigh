### About

I'm a software developer for @homeservenow and @PurpleDuck. I'm focusing on being a TypeScript guru at the moment. I'd love to start doing some video tutorials to help people build their projects :) 

I'm a speaker at Colchester Digital and I love @nest/nestjs!

#### Currently working on

I'm currently working on [@homeservenow/serverless-aws-handler](https://github.com/homeservenow/serverless-aws-handler) which is a handy handler wrapper for lambdas handlers. I'd love some help/feed back on this idea! I'm trying to make it a heavily typed unopinionated flow similar to a lot of RESTful pattern adhering frameworks!
